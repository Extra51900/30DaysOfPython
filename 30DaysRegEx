import re

re.match('i love to code', tstring,re.I)

#Match only looks at the start of the string for matches
#The re.I is for ignoring upper and lowercase
#On a no match no message is given but code does not fail so alternatively

#literally any variable but in this instance m used
if m:
  print('match found')
else:
  print('no match found')

#If a match is found, m is match object but if no match is found, m = None or falsy
#Alternatively! we can use try except

try:

except AttributeError:

#.group() and .span() essentially pull the specific substring and also .span() for instance can take the range of the given and found match
# match = re.match() -> match.group() or match.span()
